Set up grid specifications and assemble discrete Helmholtz operators in 1D, 2D, or 3D.

### What to try next

- Change `dims`, `shape`, or `lengths` to see how the grid reacts.
- Inspect `A` (e.g. `A.diagonal()[:5]`) to understand the stencil weights.
- Swap in your own discretisation class if you want higher-order stencils.
