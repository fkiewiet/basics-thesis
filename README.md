# basics-thesis

This repository houses exploratory work on Helmholtz solvers and GMRES
convergence studies.  The `src/` directory now contains a light-weight module
structure that can be imported from notebooks or scripts to organise solver
components.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the proposed modular
layout and migration steps.
